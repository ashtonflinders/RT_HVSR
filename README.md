# RT_HVSR

Quick and dirty real time HVSR monitor because it wasnt an option in swarm.

Change the relevant python path at the top.

Run from the command line as;

./real_time_HVSR.py $station $channel_prefix

where channel prefix is likely "HH", e.g.

./real_time_HVSR.py ERZ1 HH

I'll make this more elegant next week - or feel free to!
